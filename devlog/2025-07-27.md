# Devlog: 2025-07-27

- Used OpenAI Codex to bootstrap the discotool.mcp.server project.
- I really should delete the Python 3.9 install.
- Migrated project to use `pyproject.toml` and `uv` for dependency and environment management.
- Removed `setup.py` to fully adopt PEP 621/modern Python packaging.
- Imported all dependencies from `requirements.txt` into `pyproject.toml`, including platform-specific requirements.
- Attempted editable install with pip, but encountered an error due to Python version mismatch (`pyproject.toml` requires Python >=3.11, but current environment is Python 3.9.2).
- Next step: Recreate the virtual environment using Python 3.11+ to resolve the version conflict.
